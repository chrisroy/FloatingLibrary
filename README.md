20min
=====

A web(+phone) app that connects local strangers to borrow from one another. This is based on the idea that most things we own go un used most hours of any given day. eg: Tools, Equipment, Books, Films, Kitchen stuff, Cars, Bikes, and Cups of Sugar. This will save from everyone feeling like they have to own their own copy of everything. Which leads to less wasteful consumerism. Too add to the environmental saving goals, each person must be withing 20mins walking distance from eachother.
